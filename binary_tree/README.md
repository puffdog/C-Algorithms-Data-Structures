# Trees Implementation in C

This project implements binary trees and binary search trees (BST) in C. It includes functions for insertion, deletion, and traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

## Features

- **Binary Tree**:
  - Insert nodes into the binary tree.
  - Traverse the tree using in-order, pre-order, and post-order methods.

- **Binary Search Tree**:
  - Insert nodes maintaining the properties of BST.
  - Search for nodes in the tree.
  - Basic structure for deletion of nodes.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/puffdog/C-Algorithms-Data-Structures.git
   cd C-Algorithms-Data-Structures
