# Stack Implementation in C

This project demonstrates two implementations of a stack data structure in C: one using arrays and the other using linked lists. It supports basic operations such as push, pop, and peek.

## Features

- **Array-based Stack**:
  - Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
  - Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
  - Peek: View the top element without removing it.

- **Linked List-based Stack**:
  - Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
  - Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
  - Peek: View the top element without removing it.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the program using:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c stack_array.c stack_linked_list.c -o stack
