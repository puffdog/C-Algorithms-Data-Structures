# Double Linked List Implementation in C

This project demonstrates the implementation of a double linked list in C. It includes various operations such as appending, prepending, deleting nodes, and printing the list.

## Features

- **Create Node**: Dynamically allocates memory for a new node.
- **Append**: Adds a node at the end of the list.
- **Prepend**: Adds a node at the beginning of the list.
- **Delete Node**: Removes a specific node from the list.
- **Print List**: Displays the list in both forward and reverse order.
- **Free List**: Releases allocated memory for the entire list.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the program using `gcc main.c double_linked_list.c -o double_linked_list`.
3. Run the program using `./double_linked_list`.
