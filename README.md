Data Structures
1. Linked List
    Implementation of singly linked lists with operations for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
   
2. Stack
    Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists, supporting push and pop operations.
   
3. Queue
    Queue implementation using arrays and linked lists, supporting enqueue and dequeue operations.
   
4. Trees
    Implementation of binary trees and binary search trees, with functions for insertion, deletion, and traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
   
5. Hash Table
    Implementation of hash tables with collision resolution techniques (chaining).

Algorithms
1. Sorting Algorithms
    Bubble Sort: Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
    Merge Sort: Divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
    Quick Sort: Efficient sorting algorithm based on partitioning.
   
2. Searching Algorithms
    Linear Search: Sequential search for an element in an array.
    Binary Search: Efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays.

3. Graph Algorithms
    Depth-First Search (DFS): Algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
    Breadth-First Search (BFS): Algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures level by level.
