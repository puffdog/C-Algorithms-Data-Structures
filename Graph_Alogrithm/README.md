# Graph Algorithms in C

This project implements two fundamental graph traversal algorithms in C:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Algorithms Overview

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
   - It starts at the root (or any arbitrary node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures level by level.
   - It starts at the root (or any arbitrary node) and explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/puffdog/C-Algorithms-Data-Structures.git
   cd C-Algorithms-Data-Structures
