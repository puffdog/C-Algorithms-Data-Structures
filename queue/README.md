# Queue Implementation in C

This project demonstrates two implementations of a queue data structure in C: one using arrays and the other using linked lists. It supports basic operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

## Features

- **Array-based Queue**:
  - **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
  - **Dequeue**: Remove the front element from the queue.
  - **Peek**: View the front element without removing it.
  - **Capacity**: Limited by a predefined maximum size.

- **Linked List-based Queue**:
  - **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
  - **Dequeue**: Remove the front element from the queue.
  - **Peek**: View the front element without removing it.
  - **Dynamic Size**: Grows and shrinks as elements are added or removed.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/puffdog/C-Algorithms-Data-Structures.git
   cd C-Algorithms-Data-Structures
