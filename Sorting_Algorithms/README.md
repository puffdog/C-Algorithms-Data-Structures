# Sorting Algorithms in C

This project implements three sorting algorithms in C:
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Algorithms Overview

1. **Bubble Sort**:
   - A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
   - Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

2. **Merge Sort**:
   - A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
   - Divides the array into halves, sorts them and then merges them back together.
   - Efficient for large datasets.

3. **Quick Sort**:
   - An efficient sorting algorithm based on partitioning.
   - Picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.
   - Recursively sorts the partitions.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/puffdog/C-Algorithms-Data-Structures.git
   cd C-Algorithms-Data-Structures
