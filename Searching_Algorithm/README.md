# Searching Algorithms in C

This project implements two searching algorithms in C:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

## Algorithms Overview

1. **Linear Search**:
   - A simple search algorithm that checks each element of the array sequentially.
   - Useful for unsorted arrays or small datasets.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - An efficient search algorithm that works only on sorted arrays.
   - It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, discarding the half where the target cannot lie.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/puffdog/C-Algorithms-Data-Structures.git
   cd C-Algorithms-Data-Structures
